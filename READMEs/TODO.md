### Things to be done
* Sort the content of READMEs
* Sort things to be done
* How to store the current complete state of the system?
For each gauss point, of each cell, at each timestep: stress, strain, updstrain, stiffness (potentially)
For each replica, of each material type:  initial box stress, initial box dimensions (or the init binary file)
* Insert decision workflow to choose between MD simulation and Kriging estimation
* Use Pilotjob as a scheduler
* Write documentation
