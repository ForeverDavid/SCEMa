### Things to be done
* Sort the content of READMEs
* Sort things to be done
* How to store the current complete state of the system?
  - For each gauss point, of each cell, at each timestep: stress, strain, updstrain, stiffness (potentially)
* Separate initialization of MD
  - For each replica, of each material type produce:  initial box stress, initial box dimensions and the init binary file
* Insert decision workflow to choose between MD simulation and Kriging estimation
* Use Pilotjob as a scheduler
* Write documentation
